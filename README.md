# nyc-taxi-to-airport

This is a project work for the Udacity Datascience Nanodegree.

## 1. Business Understanding

My wife and me spent holidays in Manhattan in October 2018. Our taxi ride to the Newark Airport got stuck in a terrible traffic jam and we missed out flight.

The business questions I want to analyze:

### a) Should we have planned more time for the transfer?

### b) Which of the three airports has best reachability from the quarter where we stayed this time?

### c) Which quarter has best reachability to Newark Airport?

## 2. Data Understanding

## 3. Prepare Data

## 4. Model Data
